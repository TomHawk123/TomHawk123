### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mac. In 1992, I sat down to an Apple Macintosh SE and the mustard seed was planted. Less than a decade later I started NextGen computers, a successful tech advisement company. By 2004, I heard and answered the call to defend the United States of America. After two tours and years of honorable service in the US Army, I have had the privilege of being a stay at home father and am now able to pursue a career. Of course that mustard seed from 1992 had grown into a tech tree, so I did my due diligence and applied to Nashville Software School. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: the backend portion of Nashville Software School's full stack web development course, focusing on Python and Django.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a web application sprint with 3 classmates that has 27 views, user permissions, admin priviliges, and many-to-many fields.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything and everything.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've travelled all over the world and never had a passport. Thanks, Army.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning production level coding.
