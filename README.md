### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mac. In 1992, I sat down to an Apple Macintosh SE and the mustard seed was planted. Less than a decade later I started NextGen computers, a successful tech advisement company. By 2004, I heard and answered the call to defend the United States of America. After two tours and years of honorable service in the US Army, I have had the privilege of being a stay at home father to a son with special needs and am now able to pursue a career. Of course that mustard seed from 1992 had grown into a tech tree, so I did my due diligence and applied to Nashville Software School. Now I work as a full stack dev producing and publishing a mobile application. Rapidly developing and implementing my QA and Ops skillset.
