### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I LOVE to build highly scalable and efficient systems that follow SOLID design principles. 

Beyond the screen and keyboard, my life is shaped by experiences as a US Army Infantry veteran, and the joy of being a father and husband. These roles have instilled in me values that resonate in my professional life: discipline, commitment, and the importance of a supportive team.

In this ever-changing tech landscape, I'm always keen to exchange ideas, learn from others, and discover fresh opportunities. If you're on a similar path, let's connect and see where our conversations lead!
